# EIS Feature Extraction 
Repository for code used and referenced in 2024 feature extraction paper submission 
titled "Computation-efficient Approach to EIS Feature Extraction for Battery Informatics and Big Data"

This repository contains the python source code for extracting key features 
from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. 

There are two python source code files found in this repository
  1. EIS_feature_extraction - (same code but as a .py and as a .ipynb file type)
  2. PCA_analysis_for_EIS_features - (same code but as a .py and as a .ipynb file type)

The EIS_feature_extraction code works to parameterize and extract key features that 
can be used for chemometric and/or machine learning.

The PCA_analysis_for_EIS_features code loads parameterized data that was generated from the
EIS_feature_extraction code and provides a principal component analysis (PCA).
